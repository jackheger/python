- open the "notebook_jack_jerome_fx.html" for just a html version of the notebook

For the django website : 
- You can watch a short video showing the different pages on the website
- download the django_project folder, and in the directory of this folder in your terminal run this line of code :
  python manage.py runserver
  You can then go on the link and navigate through our website

For the Powerpoint : 
- open the 'ppt projet' pdf file

Other files : 
- "mapping_file.csv" file is needed to run the "notebook_jack_jerome_fx.ipynb" as it is called inside it
